## Planning

### Include diagrams, pictures, or sketches.  
### Include any iterations of versions of your plan.  
### Think about how your final product will function.  
### What materials will you need and how much?  
### What do you still need to learn for your project?
### What is the definition for "success" in your project? Don't forget to include safety concerns and your countermeasures for them. 


### Scope.  Is your project appropriately ambitious?  I want your project to stretch you.  I promise you will enjoy it more if it does.  However, I don't want your project to cause you to flee Engineering never to return.  There's a sweet spot in there.

### Schedule.  Your plan must include a thoughtful and appropriately ambitious schedule of weekly milestones.  Be specific.  "This week we will finish testing the accelerometer."  "This week, we will assemble the box and mount the Pi."  Each week, we (me and you) will use this plan to decide whether you are on track or not.  And this will have a large impact on your grade.  If we agree that your project will take 6 weeks and it takes 20, it will be very difficult to receive a good grade, regardless how awesome it is.

### Diagrams of your planned design (CAD or hand sketched)
### Block diagrams of how your code will operate
### Bill of materials for the overall project
### Risk Mitigation: Pi in the Sky projects involve projectiles, which carry inherent risk. Make sure you discuss how you are going to mitigate these risks. Think about the problem from all sides -- risk mitigation may include making sure there is enough open space around the launch, making sure everyone involved has the proper PPE (ex: safety glasses), or even that the materials (rocket motors, hairspray, etc) are stored safely. Some projects may require a safety test plan. For example, if I was to build a compressed air cannon that would operate at 100 psi, I would do several test launches at 20 psi, 40 psi, and then 60 psi. 

### Identify problem or goal
### Identify resources and constraints
### Brainstorm ideas
### Pick a solution
### Develop an initial design (pencil and paper, CAD, etc.)
### Construct a prototype
### Test your design
### Refine/optimize your design
### Present finished product
