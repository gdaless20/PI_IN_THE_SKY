## Planning


### Include any iterations of versions of your plan.  
### Think about how your final product will function.  
### What materials will you need and how much?  
### What do you still need to learn for your project?
### What is the definition for "success" in your project? Don't forget to include safety concerns and your countermeasures for them. 
### Scope.  Is your project appropriately ambitious?  I want your project to stretch you.  I promise you will enjoy it more if it does.  However, I don't want your project to cause you to flee Engineering never to return.  There's a sweet spot in there.

### Schedule

-December 14th, build a test rocket and launch on block day
-Jan 3rd, start cad for E rocket, research code for active thermometer and altimeter
-January 25th, Have cad finished for a E rocket/Have code started 
-February 15th, have code done for thermometer
-March 1st, have code done for altimeter
-March 15, have code for active readings on ground during launch
-March 29, have E rocket cad printed/cut/assembled 
-April 12, launch and readings
-April 19, several successful launches with readings
-April 26, Compile recording and documentation
-Have rocket and final launch complete April 30th 2023
-Do any final tweaks
-Project due May 19th 2023



### Diagrams of your planned design (CAD or hand sketched)
### Block diagrams of how your code will operate
### Bill of materials for the overall project
### Risk Mitigation: Pi in the Sky projects involve projectiles, which carry inherent risk. Make sure you discuss how you are going to mitigate these risks. Think about the problem from all sides -- risk mitigation may include making sure there is enough open space around the launch, making sure everyone involved has the proper PPE (ex: safety glasses), or even that the materials (rocket motors, hairspray, etc) are stored safely. Some projects may require a safety test plan. For example, if I was to build a compressed air cannon that would operate at 100 psi, I would do several test launches at 20 psi, 40 psi, and then 60 psi. 

### Identify problem or goal
### Identify resources and constraints
### Brainstorm ideas
### Pick a solution
### Develop an initial design (pencil and paper, CAD, etc.)
### Construct a prototype
### Test your design
### Refine/optimize your design
### Present finished product
