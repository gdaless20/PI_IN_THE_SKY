## Planning.


### What materials will you need and how much?  

#### We will likely need to use 3d printing material, acrylic, a midpower rocket motor, a guiding system, an altimeter, a thermometer, a Rasberry pi board, a launch site off of school grounds, and lastly, a small camera.   

### What do you still need to learn for your project?

#### We will need to learn how to code readings from a thermometer and altimeter to be seen in real-time on the ground. We will also need to learn how to design a rocket to survive high altitude and pressure along with its instruments.

### What is the definition for "success" in your project? 

#### For us to consider our project succesful we must capture altitude, temperature, and video of the launch. Our main safety concern will be the launch itself; we will have to launch at a secondary location to prevent any harm to surrounding buildings.

### Scope

#### We have gained knowledge over the past four years of engineering to make this project plausible. There is still a lot we have to learn for this project. We will have to further our coding knowledge and learn how to design a lasting rocket. There will also be lots of math calculations to determine the max weight. With all we already know, and what we have to learn, this project is perfect for testing our limits while also being able to complete the assignment.

### Risk Mitigation

#### To mitigate risk, we will have to launch the higher engine prototypes and final rocket in a field not at the school to allow a safe launch that doesn't affect other people or things. We will also discuss designs that effectively survive at high altitudes and pressure to preserve equipment and minimize fallout. Lastly, we will have a safely executed liftoff without overly excessive explosions/fire

### Schedule

#### -Jan 3rd, start cad for E rocket, research code for active thermometer and altimeter
#### -January 25th, Have cad finished for a E rocket/Have code started 
#### -February 15th, have code done for thermometer
#### -March 1st, have code done for altimeter
#### -March 15, have code for active readings on ground during launch
#### -March 29, have E rocket cad printed/cut/assembled 
#### -April 12, launch and readings
#### -April 19, several successful launches with readings
#### -April 26, Compile recording and documentation
#### -Have rocket and final launch complete April 30th 2023
#### -Do any final tweaks
#### -Project due May 19th 2023

## First test launch/What went wrong

#### When building this A motor model rocket, we were initially not going to launch it and were making it as a prototype for our final project and to get a feel for missiles. That being said, when we decided to launch the rocket, we started using superglue to be more durable and stable for launching. The original glue and superglue did not withstand the launch, and the engine shot out the back of the rocket while in the air. The parachute was packed in too tightly and not connected to the missile, so it didn't deploy, and after losing the engine, the rocket plummeted to the ground and landed on its nose.

## Project Progression

#### We knew we had a lot to get done in a short period of time. Due to our flight field restrictions we had to find a safe launch site that was large enough to safely launch our rocket. We had difficulty finding a place to launch that wouldnt require a membership or require 100$ for a shitty field that was nowhere near the required size. This resulted in us reaching out to a friend who lives in christanburg who lives on a farm. He had some date restrictions as he was leaving for varius trips meaning the time we had to complete our project was signifcantly shorter than expected. Our orriginal planned schedule was nowhere near the reality of our projects timeline. Below is the rough timeline of start to finish. 

### Schedule

#### -December 14th, build a test rocket and launch on block day.
#### -January 3rd, start cad for E rocket, research code for active thermometer and altimeter additionally relaized that we had a very short time constazint and at this point we had to get shit done.
#### -January 9th, quickly threw together wiring.
#### -January 15th, Had rocket completed and spent a lot of afterschool and BKT's working.
#### -January 18th, Realized we did not plan enough and had to build our own massive launch pad.
#### -January 27th, Had launch pad completed and spent more time finishing code and general tweaks.
#### -Febuary 6th, Wiring had to be tweaked and we forgot that the pico would have to be able to save when collecting data.
#### -Febuary 11th, Drove up to christiansburg for the 'final' launch.

## Project Progression Continued 

#### We built a capsule to hold our wiring which is shown below. We printed a smaller version for testing purposes then printed the final for our rocket. There were no major issues with this and it was the first thing we finished.
